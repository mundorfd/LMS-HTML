    <h4 style="font-size: 14pt; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px">Statement Regarding Religious Accommodation [ECAMPUS RECOMMENDED]</h4>

        accommodation. See the <a href="http://eoa.oregonstate.edu/religious-accommodation-policy">Religious Accommodation Process for Students</a>.

    <h4 style="font-size: 14pt; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px">StaClass Participation and Building Community [ECAMPUS RECOMMENDED]</h4>

    <h4 style="font-size: 14pt; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px">Expectations for Student Conduct [OSU REQUIRES URL, language may be modified]</h4>
    <p>
        Student conduct is governed by the university’s policies, as explained in the Student Conduct Code (<a href="https://beav.es/codeofconduct">https://beav.es/codeofconduct</a>). Students are expected to conduct themselves in the course (e.g., on discussion boards, email postings) in compliance
        with the university's regulations regarding civility.
    </p>
    <h4 style="font-size: 14pt; margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 12px">Academic Integrity [ECAMPUS RECOMMENDED]</h4>
    <p>
        It is important that you understand what student actions are defined as academic misconduct at Oregon State University.&nbsp; The OSU Libraries offer a <a href="https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/c.php?g=286121&amp;p=3896378">tutorial on academic misconduct</a>, and you can also refer to
        the <a href="https://beav.es/codeofconduct">OSU Student Code of Conduct</a> and <a href="https://studentlife.oregonstate.edu/studentconduct/student-info">the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards</a> for more information.&nbsp; More importantly, if you are unsure if something
        will violate our academic integrity policy, ask your professors, GTAs, academic advisors, or academic integrity officers.
    </p>
    <p>Academic misconduct, or violations of academic integrity, can fall into seven broad areas, including but not limited to: cheating; plagiarism; falsification; assisting; tampering; multiple submissions of work; and unauthorized recording and use.</p>
    <p>
        <em

    <p>
        Your instructor may ask you to submit one or more of your writings to Turnitin, a plagiarism prevention service. Your assignment content will be checked for potential plagiarism against Internet sources, academic journal articles, and the papers of other OSU students, for common or borrowed
        content. Turnitin generates a report that highlights any potentially unoriginal text in your paper. The report may be submitted directly to your instructor or your instructor may elect to have you submit initial drafts through Turnitin, and you will receive the report allowing you the
        opportunity to make adjustments and ensure that all source material has been properly cited. Papers you submit through Turnitin for this or any class will be added to the OSU Turnitin database and may be checked against other OSU paper submissions. You will retain all rights to your written
        work. For further information, visit <a href="http://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/c.php?g=286121&amp;p=1906660">Academic Integrity for Students: Turnitin – What is it?</a>

    <p>

        (unsigned) comments go to the instructor only.
